# React Virtual Scroll R&D

This repository contains a research and development (R&D) project on implementing virtual scrolling in React using different table libraries. The goal is to compare and contrast the performance, features, and ease of use of virtual scrolling in various React table components.

## Libraries Investigated

The following React table libraries were investigated in this project:

- PrimeReact DataTable
- KA-Table
- Tanstack React Table
- AG-Grid React

## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). To get started, follow these steps:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-virtual-scroll-r-and-d.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd react-virtual-scroll-r-and-d

# Install dependencies
npm install

Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

npm start
Runs the app in the development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits, and you will see any lint errors in the console.

npm test
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. See the section about running tests for more information.

npm run build
Builds the app for production to the build folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed! See the section about deployment for more information.

npm run eject
Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can’t go back! If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project. Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point, you’re on your own. You don’t have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

Virtual Scroll Implementations
Include information and code snippets related to your findings for each of the investigated libraries.

Results and Observations
Summarize your observations and results from the R&D project. Include performance metrics, notable features, and any challenges encountered during the implementation.
